abstract = {Image quality in mosaicked observations from
                  interferometric radio telescopes is strongly
                  dependent on the accuracy with which the antenna
                  primary beam is calibrated. The next generation of
                  radio telescope arrays such as the Allen Telescope
                  Array (ATA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)
                  have key science goals that involve making large
                  mosaicked observations filled with bright point
                  sources. We present a new method for calibrating the
                  shape of the telescope's mean primary beam that uses
                  the multiple redundant observations of these bright
                  sources in the mosaic. The method has an analytical
                  solution for simple Gaussian beam shapes but can
                  also be applied to more complex beam shapes through
                  chi\^{}2 minimization. One major benefit of this
                  simple, conceptually clean method is that it makes
                  use of the science data for calibration purposes,
                  thus saving telescope time and improving accuracy
                  through simultaneous calibration and observation. We
                  apply the method both to 1.43 GHz data taken during
                  the ATA Twenty Centimeter Survey (ATATS) and to 3.14
                  GHz data taken during the ATA's Pi Gigahertz Sky
                  Survey (PiGSS). We find that the beam's calculated
                  full width at half maximum (FWHM) values are
                  consistent with the theoretical values, the values
                  measured by several independent methods, and the
                  values from the simulation we use to demonstrate the
                  effectiveness of our method on data from future
                  telescopes such as the expanded ATA and the
                  SKA. These results are preliminary, and can be
                  expanded upon by fitting more complex beam
                  shapes. We also investigate, by way of a simulation,
                  the dependence of the accuracy of the telescope's
                  FWHM on antenna number. We find that the uncertainty
                  returned by our fitting method is inversely
                  proportional to the number of antennas in the
                  array.},

                  processing, computing hardware, algorithms, and data
                  handling are necessary. The Allen Telescope Array
                  ({ATA}) is a 42-antenna aperture synthesis array
                  equipped with broadband, dual polarization receivers
                  from 0.5 to 11 {GHz}. Four independent {IF} bands
                  feed 4 spectral cross correlators and 3
                  beamformers. In this paper we describe the automated
                  data processing to handle the high data rate and
                  {RFI} in close to real time at the {ATA}.},
